# Digital-Clock
# Introduction: 
* This project is a Digital Clock designed using CircuitVerse .
* Digital clock is an electronic timekeeping device that displays time in numerical format using digital circuits instead of traditional clock hands.
* it is widely used in various applications from watches and alarm clocks to microcontroller-based timing systems.
# Features: 
* The clock accurately keeps track of hours , minutes and seconds displaying the time using seven-segment display for each digit.
* It is built using flipflops , countrs , logic gates and clock signal demonstrating the practical application of sequential circuits in digital electronics.
* This project serves as a great learning toolfor understanding timing circuits , clock division , state transition etc in digital logic design.
# Components Required:
* Clock Pulse Generator
* Counters(Modulo-60 and Modulo-24)
* Flip-Flops(T Flip-Flop) and logic gates
* 7-Segmebt Display
* Reset and Control logic
